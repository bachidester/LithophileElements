# LithophileElements

These are the supplemental tables for our G-Cubed paper The Lithophile Element Budget of Earth's Core. The 14 supplemental tables are combined into one Excel spreadsheet. Captions for each table are given below:

Table S1. Starting metal and silicate compositions (in weight %) for each metal– silicate partitioning experiment in this study. As discussed in the main text, the relative proportions of the metal and silicate phases cannot be precisely controlled a priori, but are instead documented after the experiment is completed.

Table S2. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) measurements of standard minerals (San Carlos olivine, androdite, and magnetite) made on the University of Chicago Tescan Lyra3 scanning electron microscope. Each measurement was made under the same conditions as the samples reported in this study (15 kV and <2 na). Five individual measurements were made. The averages and standard deviations of these measurements are reported, along with the known compositions for comparison.

Table S3. The compositions of the metal phases for all the samples in this study in both mole fraction and weight percent. A zero in a column indicates that the element was not present in the sample. “bdl” indicates that the element was present in the sample but was below the detection limit of the instrument (i.e. 3x the standard deviation of the noise). The last column indicates the number of analyses within the metal phase of each sample.

Table S4. The compositions of the silicate phases for all the samples in this study in both oxide mole fraction and oxide weight percent. A zero in a column indicates that the element was not present in the sample. “bdl” indicates that the element was present in the sample but was below the detection limit of the instrument (i.e. 3x the standard deviation of the noise). The last column indicates whether the silicate composition was determined using a point-spread analysis (Y/N). If not, the number of analyses is given.

Table S5. The compositions of all samples used in the metal–silicate parameterization in mole fraction. For the samples in this study, a 0 indicates the element was not present in the sample, while “bdl” indicates that the element was present but below the detection limit of the instrument. For literature data, any element that was not reported in is assumed to be 0.

Table S6. Fitted coefficients for the different metal-silicate partitioning parameteri- zations discussed in this work: a full parameterization considering all possible metal and silicate compositional terms, assuming Mg partitions through an exchange reaction; a similar parameterization but assuming Mg partitions through a dissociation reaction; a parameterization that treated Mg partitioning as an exchange reaction but did not include any silicate compositional terms; and a parameterization that treated Mg partitioning as an exchange reaction but did not include any silicate or metal compositional terms.

Table S7. Covariance matrix for the fitting parameters for a full parameterization considering all possible metal and silicate compositional terms, assuming Mg partitions through an exchange reaction. Units are consistent with those in Table S6

Table S8. Correlation matrix for the fitting parameters for a full parameterization considering all possible metal and silicate compositional terms, assuming Mg partitions through an exchange reaction.

Table S9. Covariance matrix for the fitting parameters for a full parameterization considering all possible metal and silicate compositional terms, assuming Mg partitions through a dissociation reaction. Units are consistent with those in Table S6

Table S10. Correlation matrix for the fitting parameters for a full parameterization considering all possible metal and silicate compositional terms, assuming Mg partitions through a dissociation reaction.

Table S11. Covariance matrix for the fitting parameters for a parameterization that did not consider any silicate compositional terms, assuming Mg partitions through an exchange reaction. Units are consistent with those in Table S6

Table S12. Correlation matrix for the fitting parameters for a parameterization that did not consider any silicate compositional terms, assuming Mg partitions through an exchange reaction.

Table S13. Covariance matrix for the fitting parameters for a parameterization that did not include any compositional terms, assuming Mg partitions through an exchange reaction. Units are consistent with those in Table S6

Table S14. Correlation matrix for the fitting parameters for a parameterization that did not include any compositional terms, assuming Mg partitions through an exchange reaction.
